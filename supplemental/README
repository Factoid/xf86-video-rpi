The contents of this folder are bits and pieces not directly related to
the xf86-video-rpi driver that are either required for building it, or will
make setting up a development environment easier.

pkg-config/
	This directory contains .pc files used by the driver's ./configure
	script to correctly reference the /opt/vc/lib and /opt/vc/include
	directories. These files should really be included with the video
	core package, but aren't.

xorg.conf.d/
	This contains the rpi.conf file for xorg, which contains two server
	layouts. One that references the rpi driver as "rpiserver", and the
	default "fbserver", which uses the frame buffer driver. Including 
	both layouts allows you to quicky switch between drivers for comparison
	in gdb by calling "set args -layout rpiserver", or 
	"./Xorg -layout rpiserver" from the command line.

	This file should be placed in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/

xserver/
	The setup_build.sh is the flags and command line parameters I've used to
	create my debug Xorg server. Building it in this manner lets me run
	xserver/hw/xfree86/Xorg in place of the normal one for debugging. It's
	important to note that with this build I don't use "make install", just
	make, and then run the debug server directly from it's build directory.
