Overview
--------
Rasberry Pi DDX driver for the XFree86 windowing system. Rasberry Pi is built
around the broadcom BCM2835 system on a chip (SoC), which couples an arm
processor with their proprietary videocore IV GPU. The Rasberry Pi foundation
has released an API for low level and OpenGL support. This driver's purpose
is to provide hardware accelerated 2D and 3D support either natively or through
Glamor.
